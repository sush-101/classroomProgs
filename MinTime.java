/*
Abhinav is organizing a racing competation.N numbers of team (numbered as 1 to N) 
are participating in this race. Each team has M number of players. 
For each team M (team size) number of T-shirts are to be provided by the organizer. 
Each T-shirt contains a number(of that player) and may contain number of 
other player(s) of his own team.

At a time maximum P number of players(Pâ‰¤M) can run in a ground.

Rules of race are following-
* Each player takes 1 minute to complete his race.
* Players(may be all) are dependent on some other players(the player(s)number written on his T-shirt) of his team.
* A player can only start the race if player(s) number written on his T-shirt have finished their race.
* Time taken by a team to complete the race is total time taken by players of team untill all have finished the race.
Time may be infinite.
* Team who will take minimum time will be winner.
* Your task is to find winner team.

Input Format:
-------------
* The first line of the input contains an integer N denoting the number of teams
* The second line contains integer M denoting number of players of a team and D denoting 
sum of count of numbers written on T-shirt of each player(excluding his number) of a team.
* The next D lines contain two integer A and B denoting B will finish only after A finished.
* Repeat the steps 2 and 3 N times.

Output Format:
--------------
Output a single integer in a separate line denoting the team number of winner team.
If all teams take infinite time to complete the race or in case of tie output "0"(without quote).

Sample Input:
2
4 3
1 3
3 2
4 2
3 3
1 2
1 3
2 1
Sample Output:
1

Explanation:

For Team-1:
Firstly 1 and 4 finish their race simultaneously and take 1 minute, because they haven't need to wait for others.
Now 3 will finish his race in 1 minute.Since, only 2 is left ,he will finish his race in 1 minute.

Total no of time taken by Team-1 =1+1+1=3 minutes.

For Team-2:
3 and 2 will wait to finish 1,but 1 is also waiting for 2. In this situation no one can start race. Hence, 
Team-2 will take infinite time.

Team 1 will be winner.
